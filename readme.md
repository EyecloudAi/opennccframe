## OpenNCC Frame
In support of  [OpenNCC API 1.0]( https://github.com/EyecloudAi/openncc ) developers,we find the difficulties of edge intelligent engineers in product deployment and mass production! We have been thinking about how to make our developers have a set of cross platform unified programming interfaces in the face of fragmented scenarios, differentiated in-depth learning programming interfaces and customized hardware reasoning platforms, so that developers can pay more attention to their own business scenarios. This is a problem faced by our developer community and also [OpenNCC](www.openncc.com) team. According to the actual situation of our team and the feedback of community developers, we decided to build our frame on the basis of [GStreamer]( https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)  and [NNStreamer](https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer), so that [GStreamer]( https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) to support inference media pipelines, let [NNStreamer]( https://github.com/nnstreamer/nnstreamer) to support cross platform inference, the openncc team has more energy to support the product hardware platform and deep learning application layer support.    

The block diagram of openncc frame system is as follows

 Locally, it can be divided into four layers from bottom to top:

- Platform driver layer  
  Provide driver support for AI inference acceleration on different hardware platforms and operating systems  
- GStreamer plug-in support layer  
  Various inference frameworks and accelerators (such as openncc native SDK) are encapsulated into plug-ins according to nnstreamer, and business supporting modules (such as statistics and tracking) are encapsulated into GStreamer standard plug-ins to provide a plug-in warehouse for flexible business scenarios  
- Media and inference pipeline layer  
  According to the business strategy, the plug-in is combined into a inference pipeline to output events, AI results and statistical information for the upper business  
- Business application and interaction layer  
  Realize business interaction, cloud docking and local report functions

Developers who are not familiar with the GStreamer framework can develop based on the native SDK. But we suggest that developers start their work from the GStreamer framework.
